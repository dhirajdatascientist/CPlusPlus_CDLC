    - Representing age:
      ```cpp
      int age = 25;
      ```
    - Storing a score:
      ```cpp
      int score = 100;
      ```
    - Counting items:
      ```cpp
      int itemCount = 15;
      ```

2. **float** (Floating Point)
    - Storing average score:
      ```cpp
      float averageScore = 89.5;
      ```
    - Representing height in meters:
      ```cpp
      float height = 1.75;
      ```
    - Measuring liquid volume in liters:
      ```cpp
      float volume = 0.5;
      ```

3. **double** (Double Floating Point)
    - More precise value of Pi:
      ```cpp
      double precisePi = 3.141592653589793;
      ```
    - Calculating large scientific values:
      ```cpp
      double avogadroNumber = 6.02214076e23;
      ```
    - Storing precise currency amounts:
      ```cpp
      double accountBalance = 12345.67;
      ```

4. **char** (Character)
    - Storing initials:
      ```cpp
      char initial = 'A';
      ```
    - Representing grades:
      ```cpp
      char grade = 'B';
      ```
    - Indicating choices:
      ```cpp
      char choice = 'Y';  // Y for Yes
      ```

5. **bool** (Boolean)
    - Checking if an item is available:
      ```cpp
      bool isAvailable = true;
      ```
    - Seeing if a user is logged in:
      ```cpp
      bool isLoggedIn = false;
      ```
    - Verifying if a task is completed:
      ```cpp
      bool isCompleted = true;
      ```

6. **string** (String - from the Standard Library)
    - Storing a person's name:
      ```cpp
      std::string name = "Alice";
      ```
    - Representing a message:
      ```cpp
      std::string message = "Hello, World!";
      ```
    - Saving a product title:
      ```cpp
      std::string productTitle = "Wireless Mouse";
      ```
